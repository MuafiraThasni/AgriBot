# AgriBot
(A mini version of a Robot that can be used for Agricultural purposes)

The main motive for developing Agricultural Automation Technology is decreasing labor force, a phenomenon common in the developed world. The reasons are the need for improved food quality. Robotics and artificial intelligence achievements offer solutions in precision agriculture to processes related to seeding, harvesting, weed control, grove supervision, chemical applications, etc. to improve productivity and efficiency. The applications of instrumental robotics are spreading every day to cover further domains, as the opportunity of replacing human operators provides effective solutions with return on investment. When more conservative issues are granted by robotics, heavy chemicals or drugs dispensers, manure or fertilizers spreaders, etc. are activities more and more concerned by the deployment of unmanned options. All kinds of agricultural robots have been researched and developed to implement a number of agricultural products in many countries. The application of agricultural machinery in precision agriculture has experienced an increase in investment and research due to the use of robotics applications in the machinery design and task executions. Precision autonomous farming is the operation, guidance, and control of autonomous machines to carry out agricultural tasks. It motivates agricultural robotics. The goal of agricultural robotics is more than just the application of robotics technologies to agriculture. The multipurpose agricultural robots are designed to perform the basic functions required to be carried out in farms. These robots are used for agricultural operations perform autonomously such as ploughing, seed sowing and watering. The objectives of the proposed system are to plough the soil with teethâ€™s like structure and sow the seeds and to provide irrigation system by spraying water with a pump in the field.
